This repository is deprecated in favor of the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/) project and any issue opened here will be closed without resolution.

All the recipes here live now in their own feedstock (individual repository) under the conda-forge project umbrela.
You can browse the list of existing feedstocks [here](https://conda-forge.github.io/feedstocks.html).


Users are encouraged to remove the `ioos` channels and add `conda-forge`:

```shell
conda config --remove channels ioos --force 
conda config --add channels conda-forge --force`
```
